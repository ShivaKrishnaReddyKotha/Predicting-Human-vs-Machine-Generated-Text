About Dataset
This dataset contains a collection of stories designed to facilitate research in distinguishing between human-generated and machine-generated text. The dataset includes 5000 human-generated stories sourced from the ROCStories corpus and machine-generated continuations of these stories produced using the FALCON-7b language model with three different settings.

Dataset Composition:

Human-Generated Stories: The original 5000 stories from the ROCStories corpus.

Machine-Generated Stories (Setting 1): Continuations generated by FALCON-7b with balanced diversity and quality settings (Temperature: 1.0, Top-K Sampling: 50, Top-p Sampling: 0.9).

Machine-Generated Stories (Setting 2): Continuations generated by FALCON-7b with high creativity and diversity settings (Temperature: 1.5, Top-K Sampling: 100, Top-p Sampling: 0.95).

Machine-Generated Stories (Setting 3): Continuations generated by FALCON-7b with conservative and deterministic settings (Temperature: 0.7, Top-K Sampling: 20, Top-p Sampling: 0.8).

Columns:

Human Story: The original story written by a human.

Machine-Generated (Setting 1): The continuation of the story generated by the FALCON-7b model with balanced settings.

Machine-Generated (Setting 2): The continuation of the story generated by the FALCON-7b model with creative settings.

Machine-Generated (Setting 3): The continuation of the story generated by the FALCON-7b model with conservative settings.
